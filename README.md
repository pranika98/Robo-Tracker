# Robo Tracker

- When you haven't done any work then you choose the first option while creating the repo. That is you can add a README and the `clone`
- WHen you already have some work done thne you create an empty repo with nothing.
    - once repo is created you copy the link like I showed you.
    - commit current changes
        - you cannot commit anything if you haven't staged the files
        - `git add` stages the files
        ```console
        git add .               # first add (space between `add` and `.`)
        git commit -m "commit message"      # the commit
        ```
    - add the remote
        `git remote add origin https://github.com/pranika98/Robo-Tracker.git`
    - then push
        `git push -u origin master`
i'll do it abhi.
i'll explain later when i have time
